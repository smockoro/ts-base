## Motivation
When you create a typescript project each time, you need to configure the following settings.

- TypeScript compilation settings
- Lint settings for ESLint
- TypeDoc settings

This is almost the same for all projects, so we want to use a common definition.

## Positioning of this repository

The following configuration files are commonized in this repository and imported in each project.

- `tsconfig`
- `eslintrc`
- todo: typedoc configuration file

If necessary, individual projects can override the settings for their own projects.

## How to import

TBD

## How to publish common definitions

npm package and publish.
